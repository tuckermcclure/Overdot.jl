Overdot is a vehicle simulation environment. It makes it easy to create physical models, like the dynamics of a ship, and combine them with discrete-time models, such as sensors and control systems, all with easy scenario initialization, logging, and parallel Monte Carlo runs. The idea is that a user only needs to focus on their unique models, and that the entire architecture of the simulation is essentially automatic.

This work was originally developed by [An Uncommon Lab](http://www.anuncommonlab.com) under an SBIR Phase I contract with the NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center.
